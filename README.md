# importing note: 
I use this GitHub account exclusively for my college assignments.  After graduation, I won't be actively using it for new projects; instead, I'll be archiving it.  I'm keeping my portfolio up to date.  I will use a separate account for my upcoming personal and professional endeavors.  I appreciate you reading!
